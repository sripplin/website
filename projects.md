These are some of my recent-ish projects. I wish I documented some of my earlier ones, but alas. For other examples of my work and how I think, check out some of my writings.

## This Website
<p class="project-last-updated"><i>Last Updated: 2022-11-15</i></p>

In H2'2022, I redesigned my website using Jekyll (a static site generator built on Ruby) and moved hosting to Github Pages. The result is a website that is significantly faster, more performant, cleaner, and cheaper (free!). The best part is the code-first structure, allowing me complete control and customization. This enables me to write posts in markdown and use VS Code as my interface.

## Customer Based Corporate Valuation
<p class="project-last-updated"><i>Last Updated: 2019-08-12</i></p>

In my last semester at Wharton, I took a course that teaches probability models (right down to the derivation of the formulas) and their application in marketing (modeling consumer behavior such as adoption, churn, and spend).

I was especially intrigued by idea of *Customer Based Corporate Valuation (CBCV)*, to the extent that I spent a couple of months after graduation learning the technical nuances of the methodology and applying it to Chewy, which had recently went public and disclosed just enough data to do a full analysis of the company.

## Modeling the Cumulative Adoption Curve of a Product Launch
<p class="project-last-updated"><i>Last Updated: 2019-07-10</i></p>
My final project for MKTG 776: Applied Probability Models in Marketing, in which students were tasked with modeling the cumulative adoption curve of a video game after its launch. The only data given was a simple table with weekly adoption numbers. This paper assumes a technical audience, but demonstrates the predictive power of probability models and the incredible insight that can be generated from data.
