These are some of my recent-ish projects - some of which are ongoing. I wish I documented some of my earlier ones, but alas.

## This Website
<p class="project-last-updated"><i>Last Updated: 2022-11-15</i></p>

In H2'2022, I redesigned my website using Jekyll (a static site generator built on Ruby) and moved hosting to Github Pages. The result is a website that is significantly faster, more performant, cleaner, and cheaper (free!). The best part is the code-first structure, allowing me complete control and customization. This enables me to write posts in markdown and use VS Code as my interface.

## Customer Based Corporate Valuation
<p class="project-last-updated"><i>Last Updated: 2019-08-12</i></p>

In my last semester at Wharton, I took a course that teaches probability models (right down to the derivation of the formulas) and their application in marketing (modeling consumer behavior such as adoption, churn, and spend).

I was especially intrigued by idea of *Customer Based Corporate Valuation (CBCV)*, to the extent that I spent a couple of months after graduation learning the technical nuances of the methodology and applying it to Chewy, which had recently went public and disclosed just enough data to do a full analysis of the company.
