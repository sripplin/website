[CohortCharts.com](http://CohortCharts.com) is a completely free website with the largest collection of publicly available customer cohort charts.

Why? Because cohort charts are the single most useful way to understand a company’s business. They are the foundation for modeling customer processes, understanding growth dynamics, calculating customer economics, and determining value of the company.

Sadly, only a handful of companies publish these charts at all, and unfortunately they usually only appear once in an IPO filing, never to be seen again.

Over the years, I have gathered every cohort chart I could find, cataloged them, and used them as source for deeper analysis. For example, these charts enabled rich and informative analyses that I have published of [Chewy](https://steveripplinger.com/2019/08/12/chewys-ipo/) (plus a [followup](https://steveripplinger.com/2024/10/31/chewys-customer-analytics-update/)), [Unity,](https://steveripplinger.com/2020/09/08/unitys-ipo/) and [BackBlaze](https://steveripplinger.com/2021/11/09/backblaze-customer-analytics/). This way of thinking is also foundational to the idea that [Sales & Marketing is Capex](https://steveripplinger.com/2023/02/02/sm-is-capex/) (one of the most popular essays I’ve written).

Now, all these charts are available at [CohortCharts.com](https://CohortCharts.com/). There are 91 so far, and it is illuminating to see them all next to each other in one place.

My hope is that this website becomes a valuable resource for investors, founders, and anyone interested in understanding how businesses really work. Whether you're analyzing potential investments, benchmarking your own company's performance, or simply curious about customer dynamics across different business models, these charts offer a unique window into the growth of modern companies.
